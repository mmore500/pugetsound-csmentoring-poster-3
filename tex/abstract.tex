Want to be a better busy bee? Finding good software to write and run your code is a key step to leveling up as a programmer. A few (really rad) upperclassmen will be on hand to demo their favorite development environments and help you get a hands-on start in one that appeals to you. Plus, we'll have snacks. Whether you are totally new to programming or have been around the block a few times, we want to see you there! We are looking forward to building social connections between new members of the CS department and older students.
